# Budget Tracker
A PWA app

## Description
This app allows the user to track expenses. The user can add/subtract expenses. The app works with offline functionality. Therefore when expenses are added/subtracted without internet connection, then the database is updated and the tracker continues to include offline transactions once connection is returned.
